Software Architecture Fundamentals

Software architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, defining how components interact and are organized. A well-designed architecture is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and reliable systems.

Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is an approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services. Each microservice runs in its own process and communicates with other services through APIs. This contrasts with monolithic architecture where all functionality is contained in a single codebase.

Key benefits of microservices include:
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation
- Team autonomy

Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture is a software design pattern where the flow of the program is determined by events. Message queues like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ enable asynchronous communication between services. This pattern is particularly useful for building reactive systems that need to handle high volumes of data.

Database Design

Choosing the right database is critical for system performance. Relational databases like PostgreSQL use SQL and enforce ACID properties. NoSQL databases like MongoDB offer flexibility and horizontal scaling. Many modern systems use a polyglot persistence approach, combining different database types.

API Design

REST APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. GraphQL provides a more flexible alternative, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers for efficient binary serialization and is often used for service-to-service communication.

DevOps and Infrastructure

Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Docker containers package applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments. Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform enable version-controlled infrastructure management.

CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment process. This enables teams to deliver software faster and with greater reliability. Monitoring and observability tools help teams understand system behavior and quickly identify issues.
